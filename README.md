# LRUCache

A simple cache with fixed size and least-recently-used replacement strategy.
Comes with a simple pool-allocator that can be used to speedup standard containers.

This is a header-only library. 
Just add the include/ directory to your include-paths.
The makefile can be used to build the (very simple) test program.
